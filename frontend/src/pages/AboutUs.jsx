                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">The Next Life of Luxury: Sustainable, Authentic, Shared.</h2>
                    <p className="mb-6">
                        At Kanesea, we believe true luxury is enduring, not disposable. 
                        We are a community-driven platform transforming the way people engage 
                        with high-end fashion—moving beyond fast consumption to embrace a cycle 
                        of conscious acquisition and elegant exchange. Our mission is simple yet 
                        powerful: redefining the secondary luxury market through <strong>authenticity, environmental responsibility, and timeless value.</strong> 
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">💚 Our Core Mission</h2>
                    <p className="mb-6">
                        We created Kanesea to honor a vital promise: to merge luxury 
                        aspiration with the <strong>Go Green Initiative</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        <strong>Sustainable Fashion:</strong> Every piece sold prevents manufacturing 
                        waste and reduces the fashion industry's carbon footprint. We are making 
                        luxury inherently more sustainable, one beautiful item at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        <strong>Back to Basics:</strong> We celebrate the heritage of luxury—the era 
                        when high-quality pieces were cherished and passed down. We foster a 
                        culture where <strong>sharing within the community is not a taboo</strong>, but a mark 
                        of smart, responsible stewardship.
